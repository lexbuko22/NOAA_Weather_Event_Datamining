Title: Analyzing NOAA Storm Event Data

Team Members: Lex Bukowski, Matt Tuttle

Project Description: The goal of the project is to enhance our understanding of severe storms and the damage they cause to humans and property by looking at any possible correlations that may exist in the data. The proposed project will utilize data mining techniques to uncover value in the massive amount of data that the NOAA has collected over the past 70+ years. By implementing methods such as clustering, classification, and regression, this project will provide storm forecasters, community leaders and decision makers, and everyday citizens with key information about storm events and the damage and destruction that they may bring.

Summary of the questions sought and the answers:

- Have weather events become more dangerous to people?

Tornado and Hurricane event types were analyzed and no statistically relevant correlation exists in the data set for an increase in injuries over time for these weather events.

- Is the magnitude property damage indicative of higher risk of injury to people?
  
No, no statisically significant trend exists between damage cost and injury count.

- Has the damage caused by severe weather events increased over time?

No, there is not a siginicant corellation between the damage cost of severe weather events over time.

- Have severe weather events increased over time?

No, the regression analysis shows a the frequency of each event type as well as the total count of all events has no siginifcant correlation over time.
